# 5. Race

## 5.1. General Remarks
Participants are obliged to behave in a sporting and fair manner. The behaviour of their assistants (supervisors, team members, etc.) will be ascribed to them.

All race control decisions are final and not appealable. Further clarification can be sought from the organizers after the race is over.

## 5.2. Briefing Document
All Teams will receive an Event Briefing document via a posting in the #documents-and-forms channel in Discord one week before event day.

Stipulations listed in the briefing document or communicated in the Drivers’ Briefing are binding for all participants and must be strictly adhered to.

## 5.3. Drivers' Briefing
The briefing prior to the start of the event takes place in the Series Discord (Stage: briefing-room) and is performed by VCO Sporting Management in conjunction with Race Control.

Should non-participation or incomplete attendance at the Drivers’ Briefing be ascertained, Race Control can impose a ten-second time penalty for the respective race.

Driving on the public practice or race servers during the Drivers’ Briefing is forbidden. Race Control can impose a ten-second time penalty or penalty points for the respective race.

## 5.4. Start Type
All races will utilise a rolling start with a defined start zone to be communicated in the official Event Briefing. Each class will start separately with a gap of five seconds left by the TC leader to the last car in the GTD field.

Should the leader of either class be judged to start outside of the start zone or not maintaining a constant speed, Race Control can impose a ten-second time penalty for the respective race.

## 5.5. Race Duration
All races are 2 hours 40 minutes in length.

Teams retiring from the race for no apparent reason may be excluded from the series for the remainder of the season.

The reason for retiring from the race can be reported to Race Control in the Series Discord in the specific Team channel.

## 5.6. Vehicle Paintwork
All teams are invited to run their individual team liveries during all events, using the mandatory IMSA EGC livery template for each of the cars used. The templates can be found here: https://v-c-o.info/imsaliveries

For the First Round, the submission deadline for paint files is 9th October 2022 at 20:00 CEST. This is to facilitate the IMSA and VCO approval process and to allow for media creation.

Any paint updates must be submitted by Monday, 20:00 CEST, before the respective event day.

Liveries must be uploaded to RaceSpot Media (https://racespot.media) using the correct iRacing Team ID associated with an entry.

## 5.7. Race Control
Race Control consists of the Race Director and Stewards. Incidents are evaluated during the race (live race control).

## 5.8. Drive Time Requirements
During each race, both drivers in a car are subject to minimum and maximum drive times. The minimum drive time for all drivers is 45 minutes. The maximum drive time is 1 hours 55 minutes.

Drive time will be initially calculated by multiplying a driver’s average lap time with total laps completed. If a driver is found to be over or under the limit, their time will be manually calculated by checking a driver’s total drive time between the green flag and the car taking the chequered flag, not inclusive of time spent in pit lane (marked by pit lane cones).

If a team is given permission to ESC to pit lane, drive time stops accruing at the moment the car performs the ESC. Drive time resumes when the car leaves the pit lane.

In the rare situation that a red flag interrupts the race requiring a new session to be created, drive time will be reset and scaled to the new session duration. The driver in the car at the time of the red flag will be required to restart the race.


## 5.9. Drive Time Penalties
If a car does not meet the drive time requirements, the car will be placed at the back of the field behind all cars, including those that are unable to finish.

First, cars that have completed less than 90% of the race time remain in their finishing order unless they have exceeded the maximum drive time.

For cars that exceeded the maximum drive time, the car with the driver least exceeding the maximum drive time will be classified in front of the others.

Finally, for cars completing 90% or more of the race time where a driver did not achieve the minimum drive time, the car with the driver that missed by the smallest amount will be classified in front of the orders

## 5.10. Finish Line
The finish line only applies on the circuit, not the pit lane.

## 5.11. Penalties
Next to in-race penalties and automated penalties depending on the sim platform, VCO Race Control will have the chance to award post-race penalties per team for any incident not fully reviewed before the end of a race.

## 5.12. Protests
Protests can be lodged by a Team Manager during a race and up to one hour after crossing the line in a race by using the VCO IMSA Team Hub (https://v-c-o.info/imsa-hub).

The protest form requires the following information that must be given completely and correctly:

- Which car numbers are involved in the incident?
- What lap did the incident occur on?
- What corner did the incident occur in?
- What is the time stamp of the incident?
- A reason for the protest
- Short description of the incident
Protests lodged after this deadline has expired will be regarded as inadmissible.

Protests must be lodged by a driver/team directly involved in the incident. Protests from drivers/teams who are not involved will not be accepted.

## 5.13. Settings & Weather
All sessions will use Dynamic Weather and Skies along with a set in-sim time to be used to generate the session. These details will be communicated to drivers in the official Event Briefing.
