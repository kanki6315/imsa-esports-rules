# 10. Safety Car Regulations

## 10.1. Safety Car
If the Race Director determines a Safety Car is warranted for a stranded car or a mass pile up, the automated iRacing Safety Car System will be utilised to trigger a caution.

As the iRacing System does not inherently support multi-class racing, we have devised an additional procedure to mirror the IMSA Safety Car Process.

As soon as the Safety Car is triggered, cars may freely ESC back to pit lane without requesting permission from Race Control.

## 10.2. Additional Safety Car Process
The iRacing Safety Car will always pick up the overall leader of the race.

The Safety Car Process only begins once all cars are queued up behind the safety car. The first time past pit lane, pit lane will open only for the faster class (GTD). On the second time past pit lane, pit lane will be open only for the slower class (Touring Car). On the third and final scheduled lap under pacing, pit lane will be open for all cars. On each lap, pit entry and exit is only opened by the Race Director and not by iRacing.

As the field makes its third and final scheduled lap under pacing, the passaround will begin. The Race Director will ask drivers to stay on the left side of the track to allow cars to take the wave around on the right. Any drivers in front of their class leader and behind the pace car will be instructed to take the wave around – these drivers will have just one lap to close the gap to the tail end of the field.

After the wave around has been completed, the field will remain in single file until the green flag flies – the leader of the safety car queue will be required to start in the start zone communicated via the Event Briefing. Cars are permitted to pass once the leader has re-started the race.

Cars are permitted to make Emergency Service if they are unable to make it to their designated pit lap. If a team takes less than 5 seconds of service, they will be required to re-enter pitlane along with the rest of their class and take additional service but will serve no further penalty. Teams that take more than 5 seconds of service will be required to serve a 10s Stop and Hold penalty after the green flag resumes. Teams that perform a Driver Change will be required to serve a 60s Stop and Hold penalty after the green flag resumes.

Any cars that enter a closed pit lane but remains in pit lane until after two green flag laps have been completed will not incur further penalty

## 10.3. Quick Yellow
In the 15 minutes after a caution and during the last 30 minutes of the race, the Quick Yellow will be used in the event of the Race Director calling for the Safety Car. If a Quick Yellow is followed immediately by another caution period, the Full Safety Car process will apply instead.

In a quick yellow, pit lane is never opened to teams. At Race Control’s discretion, there may be a passaround applied. In the event that Race Control determines there is sufficient time for a passaround, the Race Director will add an additional lap under caution to perform the passaround before restarting in single-file.

Pit lane will be open on the restart for cars requiring service.

Cars are permitted to make Emergency Service if they are unable to make it to the end of the Quick Yellow. If a team takes less than five seconds of service, they will be required to re-enter pitlane at the first possible opportunity (on the restart) to take additional service. Teams that take more than 5 seconds of service will be required to serve a ten-second Stop and Hold penalty after the green flag resumes. Teams that perform a Driver Change will be required to serve a 60-second Stop and Hold penalty after the green flag resumes.

Any cars that enter a closed pit lane but remains in pit lane until after the field has passed the pit exit on a race restart will not incur further penalty.
