# 3. Entries

## 3.1. Teams / Drivers
Up to 44 Esports Racing teams (hereafter Teams) will take part in the 2022 IMSA EGC. They enter the event either after being nominated by an IMSA recognized manufacturer, or after being invited by the organizer. Teams are approved for participation by the sole discretion of the organizer.

Each manufacturer (GTD: BMW/Ferrari/Lamborghini/McLaren/Mercedes/Porsche & TC: Honda/Hyundai) is allotted two nominations. Any Teams nominated by a manufacturer will receive a guaranteed entry into the series.

Each manufacturer is also guaranteed a certain number of cars running. In GTD, each manufacturer will have five cars running while in TC, each manufacturer will see seven cars on the grid.

Each Team is asked to nominate a roster for the IMSA EGC via the VCO IMSA Team Hub (https://v-c-o.info/imsa-hub) by 25th September 2022 at 19:00 CEST. This roster must include exactly two drivers that will compete for a Team. In the case more than two drivers are added to the VCO IMSA Team Hub, Teams must communicate the two full-season drivers via their private channels in the IMSA EGC Discord. Each Team is also allotted two “jokers” which will allow a driver not on the full-season roster to compete for a Team. This joker must be communicated to the organizers before the Wednesday prior to each event and added on the VCO IMSA Team Hub.

It is mandatory that any drivers representing a Team in an official IMSA EGC session uses the account on the respective platform in his own name to compete in the event. Should a different driver use the account of the driver, there will be immediate exclusion from the event for the respective Team.

It is also required that any drivers representing a Team in an official IMSA EGC session uses the specific iRacing account and specific iRacing team registered via the VCO IMSA Team Hub. Should a driver register with the incorrect account or team for a Race Session, there will be a resulting penalty during the event for the respective Team.

The organizer may refuse to accept an entry without giving a reason and is entitled to exclude every driver/team from an individual event or the full competition without giving a reason.

It is mandatory for each driver to join the IMSA EGC Paddock Discord Server via https://v-c-o.info/imsaesports.

Each Team is asked to nominate a single Entry Manager that will be responsible for updating team information via the VCO IMSA Team Hub. Other members of team management will be able to gain access to the Team specific channels in the Series Discord via the VCO IMSA Team Hub.

GTD: BMW M4 GT3, Ferrari 488 GT3 EVO, Lamborghini Huracan GT3 EVO, McLaren MP4-12C GT3, Mercedes AMG GT3 EVO, Porsche 911 GT3 R

Drivers will be permitted open-setups during each race.

iRacing.com will provide a custom Balance of Performance (BoP) for each class before each Round. This BoP will be communicated to drivers one week before the race. 

## 3.3. Car / Vehicle Numbers
Teams will be provided free choice of car numbers. However, car numbers in GTD will be required to be between 2 and 99 (with no preceding 0s). TC car numbers will be required to be between 102 and 199.

## 3.4. Incapability / Substitution
Should a driver not be able to participate at one of the event days, the Team needs to notify the organiser via the respective Team channel on Discord. Teams are permitted two “jokers” through the season to replace drivers. Teams must inform the organiser by the Wednesday prior to the event. Joker drivers must also be added to the VCO Team Hub.

Teams that miss rounds of the championship may lose eligibility for future IMSA EGC seasons.
