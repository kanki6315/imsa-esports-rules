# 6. Penalties

## 6.1. In-Race Penalties
If Race Control believes that an in-race penalty should be awarded, it will use the following scale to distribute a penalty. Race Control reserves the right to apply a harsher penalty for a second offence, or, an incident that takes a driver out of a prize paying position.

| Penalty Code | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

| NFA          | No Further Action                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| P01          | Warning This is for the most minor of infractions. A driver will be allowed to accrue three warnings over the course of the event before receiving either a P03 / P04 Penalty                                                                                                                                             |
| P02          | Return Position A driver will be required to give the position gained back at the earliest opportunity (and within one lap of being issued by Race Control). The driver will also accrue a P01 warning. If this takes the driver over the warning threshold, a P03 / P04 Penalty will be applied in lieu of this penalty. |
| P03          | Drive Through Penalty A driver will be required to drive down pit road at the speed limit. A driver will have to serve this within three laps of being issued.                                                                                                                                                            |
| P04          | Stop And Hold Penalty A driver will be required to drive down pit road at the speed limit. The driver will then need to remain in their pit stall. A driver will have to serve this within three laps of being issued. Race control is able to give out S/H penalties between 0 and 60 seconds.                           |
| P05          | Disqualification The driver will be disqualified from the event.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| P06          | Time Penalty Time will be added onto the driverâ€™s race time, and any positions that this will take them behind will be lost.                                                                                                                                                                                              |
