# 9. Driving Standards

## 9.1. General Rules
These rules apply at all times during the event, regardless of session. They provide a general set of expectations of all drivers. These have been created to protect the professionalism of the IMSA EGC.

## 9.2. Entering / Exiting Pit Road & Car
Drivers should not drive through pit stalls, and especially not through other drivers. Drivers who drive through multiple pit stalls may be assessed a penalty by Race Control.

## 9.3. Driving On Track - Reasonable Speed
Drivers should maintain a reasonable speed at all times when on track, and not drive in such a way that has the potential to impede other drivers, regardless of if drivers are impeded or not. This includes the following:
- Not moving onto the racing line when manoeuvring onto track from the pitlane, until at a reasonable speed
- Not deliberately slowing down on track to impact upon any other car

For the avoidance of doubt, ‘reasonable’ is seen as:
- 75% of racing speed in Sectors 2 and 3 of an outlap.
- 75% of racing speed at all other times whilst a driver is on track.
- Returning to 75% of racing speed as soon as possible after a spin / other on track incident, as and when safe to do so.

This will be reviewed based upon a driver’s fastest lap time in either practice or qualifying.

Drivers who do not maintain reasonable speed will receive a P01 warning as a minimum penalty, with additional penalties if they are deemed to have impeded other drivers (P02 - P04).

## 9.4. Racing Rules
Drivers are reminded that safe overtaking is the responsibility of both drivers involved. Allow other participants enough space when overtaking (avoiding ‘netcode’) and do not drive into gaps that do not exist. Even if it does not create a spin or a crash, Race Control reserve the right to review incidents where a driver is placed at a significant disadvantage due to an ‘unjustifiable risk’. This would include:

- A late move, forcing a driver to move off the racing line to avoid an incident
- Moving sideways in a corner to move another driver off line
- Not allowing room for a driver to make, run through, or exit a corner.

## 9.5. Off Track Incidents
Track limits are defined by the iRacing Track Limits except where defined by Race Control in the Event Briefing.

Only Race Control is able to file a protest against a Team for Track Limits Violations. Offenders will receive a P01 warning as a minimum penalty, with additional penalties if Race Control deems the violation is repeated and deliberate.

## 9.6. On Track incidents
Drivers should slow down for any incident on track, as displayed by an in-sim Yellow Flag. Drivers who attempt to gain an advantage by not slowing down for an incident ahead may receive a P01-PR04 penalty. This will depend on the amount of time gained, and the risk to other drivers by failing to slow down appropriately.

In the event that a driver is involved in an incident which forces their car to spin or crash, they are not allowed to rejoin the racing line until such a time that it is safe for them to do so. Even if the fault for the initial incident rests with another driver, a driver who fails to rejoin the track safely will receive a P02-P04 penalty.

Retaliation of any sort is not accepted. Drivers who attempt to seek revenge on another driver on track will receive a P05 penalty, and will be immediately disqualified from the event.

## 9.7.	Damaged Race Cars
Drivers who are unable to maintain an acceptable racing speed may be alerted by Race Control that they are driving too slowly. In this case, drivers will be required to bring their speed up to an acceptable speed within two laps (Typically 107% of the fastest driver on track).

In the event that a driver is unable to meet the necessary, acceptable speed after these two laps, they will be issued with a black flag, and must return back to pit road. Drivers failing to obey this black flag, or who return a damaged car back onto track after the black flag will receive a P05 penalty (disqualification).

Damaged cars MUST return to pit road if they are likely to become lapped traffic on the following lap. Race Control will communicate this information to drivers in this situation.

## 9.8.	Cooldown Rules
It’s forbidden to use ESC during the race sessions without approval from Race Control.

Drivers are not allowed to crash into other drivers, even after all others have passed the start/finish line. Drivers who do so will be investigated and may receive a P04/P06 penalty.

Using ESC to return to pit road is allowed only during practice and qualifying.
