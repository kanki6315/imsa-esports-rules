# 8. General Regulations

## 8.1. Livery
Changing the position and size of the logos contained on the template provided by the organizers is not permitted. It is permitted to add individual team logos.

The final design of the liveries is solely at the discretion of VCO.

## 8.2. Own Logos / Design
By providing livery files to VCO, the Team declares that all necessary approvals for using the respective logos and design elements exist. In the event of claims, the driver is liable. The organisers of the series are not liable for any third-party claims.

Any logo or livery upload making an association with a political party, pornographic, xenophobic, or otherwise similarly problematic content is forbidden and will result in exclusion from the series.

VCO has the right to deny the usage of a logo without explanation.

## 8.3. Communication
Availability via the respective team text channel in Discord is mandatory.

Text communication will take place solely via the respective relevant channels in the Series Discord.

It is expected that behaviour over the voice and text chat is professional. If a driver abuses these communication channels, Race Control will remove their ability to use them.

Post-race interviews will be conducted via TeamSpeak (ts.racespot.tv) upon request of the organizers via the team’s text channel.

Use of the in-game chat functions integrated in the sim platforms is not permitted during all official qualifying and race sessions.

## 8.4. Mandatory Race Day Connections
It’s mandatory that all drivers join the VCO Race Control Zoom Call from 13:30 ET (11:30 ET for Round 2) at all events in order to give proof of their identity and for usage in the Broadcast. Failure to do so will result in penalties at the discretion of VCO.

Teams are also required to make use of the team specific voice channels in the Series Discord from after the event briefing until the broadcast has finished or a team retires from an event.

We highly recommend you disable audio notifications in Discord as members of the broadcast team may join your channel during the race to add insight to the broadcast.

## 8.5. Computer System Requirements
The participant's computer and internet connection specifications must meet the minimum requirements for the simulation in competition mode. Teams may be penalized and excluded from the event if their hardware or internet connections do not meet the minimum requirements and disrupt the natural flow of the event.
